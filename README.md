### Hello!

I'm Garrett and I've been building web stuff since I was 10. It became a serious hobby in 2009 when I started creating open source projects that garnered attention from sites like [ZDNet](https://web.archive.org/web/20151227061053/https://www.zdnet.com/article/hp-touchpad-homebrew-patches-that-improve-productivity/) and [Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/2011-07-05-touchpad-homebrew-patches-surface-in-preware-devs-keep-on-givin.html), smaller blogs, and the community in general. In 2016, I turned my hobby into a career, developing software solutions for the healthcare industry as a senior software engineer. Over the last 15 years, I've learned a lot about planning, designing, building, releasing, and supporting professional-grade software used by thousands of people. So much so that I started my own company in 2023.

You can find all of my most recent and best work over at [Nothing Special](https://github.com/NothingSpecialDev).
