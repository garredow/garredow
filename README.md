### Hello!

I'm Garrett and I've been building web stuff since I was 10. It became a serious hobby over 15 years ago and I've built plenty of cool things to share with others. I've also been doing web development professionally for over 8 years now. If that wasn't enough, I recently started up my own thing at [Nothing Special](https://nothingspecial.io)

I love everything about web development: Gathering requirements, building products, setting up CI/CD pipelines, configuring servers, etc. It's so much fun taking an idea, making it a reality, and sharing it with others. I specialize in building web apps for obscure, underpowered, not-well-documented platforms like webOS, Firefox OS, and currently KaiOS. Building for those kinds of platforms adds a whole nother layer of complexity and challenge, which just adds to the fun.

Feel free to take a look around!
