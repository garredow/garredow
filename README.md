### Hello!

I'm Garrett and I've been building web stuff since I was 10. It became a serious hobby in 2009 and I've learned a lot about planning, building, releasing, and supporting professional-grade software with thousands of users since then. In 2016, I turned my hobby into a career, developing software solutions for the healthcare industry as a senior software engineer. Recently, I've started up my own company and have big plans for the future.

You can find all of my recent and best work over at [Nothing Special](https://github.com/NothingSpecialDev).
