### Hello!

I'm Garrett and I've been building web stuff since I was 10. It became a serious hobby in 2009 when my open source work started garnering some attention from major sites like ZDNet and Engadget, as well as smaller tech blogs and the broader community. In 2016, I turned my hobby into a career, developing software solutions for the healthcare industry as a senior software engineer. Over the last 15 years, I've gained extensive experience planning, designing, building, releasing, and supporting professional-grade software used by thousands of people. In 2023, I launched my own company to keep doing what I love most: building cool apps, libraries, and tools for any web-based platform I can find.

You can find all of my most recent and best work over at [Nothing Special](https://github.com/NothingSpecialDev)!
