### Hello!

I'm Garrett and I've been building things and sharing them with others for over 15 years. I love everything about web development: Gathering requirements, building products, setting up CI/CD pipelines, configuring servers, etc. It's so much fun taking an idea, making it a reality, and sharing it with others. I specialize in building web apps for obscure, underpowered, not-well-documented platforms like webOS, Firefox OS, and currently KaiOS. Building for those kinds of platforms adds a whole nother layer of complexity and challenge, which just adds to the fun. Feel free to take a look around.

Also, come see what I'm working on over at [Nothing Special](https://github.com/NothingSpecialDev)! Lots of great things ahead.
